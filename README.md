# Discord_Timestamper
A timestamp generator for Discord using the command line.

This application uses the current time to find a timestamp based on the input options of how much time in the future or past you wish the timestamp to occur at.

**The application currently does not support inputting a specific Date/Time but this may be supported in the future.**

More information on Discord timestamps can be found on [Discords Developer Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting-timestamp-styles).
